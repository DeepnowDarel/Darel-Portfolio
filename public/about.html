<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>There is not much about me which can be said conclusively.Every image that i have made of myself, I have found them 
  to be false and mostly to have a sense of identity. But ultimately who I am, a question which is yet to be answered, 
  is what I think gives me a purpose.</p>

<p>This passion for web development is a new-found one for me. I have tried many things in the past, but could not make
  much out of them. Now I realise that it is all about trying something, but not about making something out of them.</p>

<p>Web is slowly becoming the new world. But I would rather stay in the real world, instead of the virtual world it is creating. 
Why should I when I have an amazing reality out there which is yet to be explored in its fullness.</p>
